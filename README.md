### Forked from [puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool)
## Improvements
1. Add multi-class support 
2. Change some of the color-candidates for better display
3. Fix the 'Example' filepath for convenience
4. Change the image format from '.JPEG' to '.JPG'

## New Usage
### For multi-class task, modify 'class.txt' with your own class-candidates and before labeling bbox, choose the 'Current Class' in the Combobox and make sure you click 'ComfirmClass' button.

### The remaining usage is the same as the origin one.
